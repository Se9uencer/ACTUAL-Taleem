description: Optimize development workflow by preventing redundant `npm run dev` calls and using on-screen debug boxes instead of relying solely on console logs. This improves performance, reduces clutter, and makes debugging easier by displaying variable values directly in the UI.

Whenever you're working in this project, follow these custom rules:

1. **Do NOT run `npm run dev` in a new terminal** every time.
   - Instead, reuse the existing development server if it's already running.
   - Only suggest restarting it if there are critical build errors or config changes that require it.

2. When debugging, use **visual on-screen debugging boxes**:
   - Inject lightweight UI boxes or overlays that display key variable values (e.g. `user.id`, `theme_accent_color`, `assignedStudents.length`, etc.).
   - Style them to be unobtrusive (e.g. bottom corner or floating sidebar).
   - This allows me to screenshot and show you exactly what values are being passed or rendered without checking the console or logs.

3. You may suggest deleting the debug boxes after the issue is fixed to clean up the UI, but donâ€™t remove them prematurely.
